*How Bile generates based on time stamps

.	BILE only considers the mdates of the input file, output file and template file, 
	not any inclusions into the template file (may change, in which case the 
	latest(mdate) of all included files is used as the mdate of the template)

If...

	an output file doesn't exist for the input file, the "new" flag is set 
	and the output generated

Else

	If an output file exists and dated earlier

	i) than the input file, the output is regenerated and the "modified" flag set
	ii) than the template file, the output is regenerated, but no flag set


If the user sets the "force" flag, all output files are regenerated regardless
