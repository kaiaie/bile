Want: automatic ability to add functions to build.

That is, create new .c and .h file for functions, put it in a 'functions' 
subdir (not vital but helps keep source tree clean), type 'make' and have 
the new functions integrated.

The functions are held in a list of name/value pairs; the name is a string 
which is the function's name, the value a pointer to the function.  Functions 
take argc, argv arguments (possibly need to take a 'context' parameter too but 
leave aside for now) We need to generate a .c file containing an intialisation 
function that builds this list.

(Possible problems with include paths for my lists?)


This extension mechanism also to be used for file handlers.

Also, can this be made sufficiently general to allow for "plugins" later?

It doesn't have to be a list; could be a big if or switch statement and have 
a "call" function... for plugins, you probably want a list...

Probably better to build the functions subdir as a library and link that...
